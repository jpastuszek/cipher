Feature: Encrypting and decrypting streams with CLI application
  In ordre to be useful in shell cipher provides CLI application
  This application can take input stream and produce encrypted or decrypted stream

  Background: 

  #Given cipher will print it's output
  #Given decipher will print it's output
  Scenario: Usage display
    Given cipher argument -h
    Given cipher is running
    When I wait for cipher termination
    Then cipher output should include 'Usage:'

  Scenario: Encrypt to stdout with AES256-CBC by default
    Given cipher is running
    When I write test.txt to cipher input
    Then I wait for cipher termination
    And cipher output should include following entries:
      | cipher "AES"          |
      | mode "CBC"            |
      | key_size 256          |
      | session_key           |
      | initialization_vector |

Feature: Encrypting and decrypting streams with different encryption parameters

  Background: 
    Given cipher argument -p test
    Given decipher argument -p test
    Given content of test.txt file is used as cipher input
